					I operated as Director of Technology for Reptile Consulting &amp; Services.
					The teams I managed consisted of
					software engineers,
					system administrators,
					and tech support specialists.

					It was also necessary for me to "wear multiple hats" and do what is necessary to get things done, as the company was being grown.
					At times I also took on the roles of
					software engineer,
					project manager,
					system administrator,
					tech support specialist,
					computer hardware specialist,
					and numerous other roles.
