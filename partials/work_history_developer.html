				<h4 class="title summary">Principal Software Engineer &amp; Architect</h4>

			<div class="description">
				<p>
					At Electronic Arts I worked on (and was one of the original founders of) one of the few <em>advanced development teams</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This <em>advanced development team</em> focused on creating
					reusable and often highly scalable technologies
					for web-based applications and in-game content,
					to be used by the various delivery teams.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also created a plan to move Electronic Arts to taking a data-driven and scientific approach
					to marketing, employing machine learning, statistics and data science.
				</p>
				<p>
					More concretely, on a day-to-day basis, my work experience was multifaceted.
					(Which fluctuated to some degree, as accommodations needed to be made when the company went through a number of reorganizations.)
					Overall, those facets of my day-to-day work experience is a follows.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Technical vision</em> was one of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
					I provided the <em>long term vision</em> for (some of the) software systems, technologies and infrastructure.
					Often this amounted to looking at our long term needs and deciding <em>what</em> should be done.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>System architecture</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
					Designing and architecting software systems.
					I am a fan of data-driven architecture; and continued using that technique at Electronic Arts.
					When the problem being solved warranted it,
					<abbr title="proof of concept">POC</abbr>s were created to validate alternate architectures, and choices between <abbr title="proof of concept">POC</abbr> were made based on data from simulations and production data.
					I also had the reified systems instrumented so that we could collect data, and make future architecture decisions based on data.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Software engineering</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
					Which included programming and writing code.
					I am not a fan of (what is sometimes called) "ivory tower architecture" and was adamant about not being one at Electronic Arts.
					I engineered and programmed many of the systems I architected.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Technical oversight</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
					I provided oversight and guidance to other software engineers and system architects,
					both in formal and informal settings.
					Reviewing (some amount of the) major designs and architecture decisions from engineers' &amp; architects' and providing feedback when needed;
					as well as helping to overcome architecture problems that may have been found in the review process.
					Some mentoring was also part of this facet.
					Also, another form of <em>technical oversight</em> was of technical systems and came from a more data-based sources;
					such as time series, tracing and logging data from our production system;
					which indicated architecture problems, and called for action (and sometimes planning) to deal with the discovered problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Hiring</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
					I was involved in (some amount of) the interviewing and screening of potential hires for software engineering and system architecture roles.
				</p>
				<p>
					(This was a 49 Research on-site long term contract, through Ignite Technical.)
