					Back when blogging first went mainstream, "everyone" wanted to get into blogging.
					Today blogs and blogging are ubiquitous and banal.
					However, back then blogs were still a new technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the time, companies were just starting to get interested blogging
					and feel that it was important to have a coroprate blog.
					And many individuals saw opportunity with blogging.
				</p>
				<p>
					WordPress (a free and open source blogging platform) was in the right place
					at the right time, and became the <em>de facto standard</em> blogging software of the time.
					WordPress was what "everyone" used, when they wanted to set up their own blog.
				</p>
				<p>
					Companies who wanted to use WordPress either wanted to make WordPress look like their
					existing corporate websites or make it look like a PSD file they had an artist create.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, making WordPress look like their website (or the design in a PSD file) was difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's where MakeWordpress.com came in.
					MakeWordpress.com took out the difficulty.
					MakeWordpress.com did all the hard work for the customer.
					MakeWordpress.com made Wordpress look how the customer wanted it to look.
				</p>
				<p>
					I founded MakeWordpress.com.
					I was the lead product manager at MakeWordress.com
					where I managed all customer related and internal <em>product development</em>.
