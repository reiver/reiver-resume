			<h2>Roles</h2>
			<p>
				I am flexible in what role I can take on
				—
				as I have decades of experience working as a
				<strong>software engineer</strong>,
				<strong>engineering manager</strong>,
				<strong>product manager</strong>,
				<strong>project manager</strong>,
				<strong>executive (CTO & CEO)</strong>,
				<strong>board member (director & chairman)</strong>,
				and
				<strong>advisor</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having worked at many many start-ups — I have often had to wear-multiple-of-these-hats simultaneously.
			</p>

			<h2>Nowadays (Engineering)</h2>
			<p>
				Nowadays when I am taking on a software engineering role —
				I tend to program in the <strong>Go programming language</strong> (<strong>Golang</strong>),
				with some JavaScript programming from time-to-time.
			</p>
			<p>
				(I have been programming in Golang since 2013.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Although I have programmed in many many different programming languages over the decades, and am comfortable learning new programming languages and technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nowadays the off-the-shelf databases I tend to use are <strong>Postgres</strong> and <strong>SQLite</strong>.
				In the not-too-distant-past I also frequently used MySQL and MongoDB.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I am comfortable learning new database platforms.
				Or even creating a new bespoke database platform from scratch if the need arises — it has before.
