		<p>
			At Reptile Consulting &amp; Services I worked as a <strong>senior software engineer</strong> (in addition to my management and executive roles &amp; duties).
		</p>
		<p>
			Reptile Consulting & Service was a computer and Internet consulting and services company. Although Reptile had customers in many industries, its specialized in the medical industry â€” in particular optometry and ophthalmology.
		</p>
		<p>
			I designed, created, and operated bespoke software for the customers of Reptile Consulting &amp; Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was also necessary for me to "wear multiple hats" and do what is necessary to get things done, as the company was being grown.
			At times I also took on the roles of
			software engineer,
			director of technology,
			project manager,
			system administrator,
			tech support specialist,
			computer hardware specialist,
			and numerous other roles.
