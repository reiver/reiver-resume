			Stakewise, a popular open-source Ethereum staking application â€” written primarily in the Solidity programming language.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was asked to fork StakeWise to other blockchain-networks (other than the Ethereum blockchain-network).
			I did this work using the Solidity programming language.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Figured out how the StakeWise v3-core source-code worked.
				Both the contract and the deployment scripts.
			</li>
			<li>
				Wrote detailed developer documentation on how the StakeWise v3-core source-code works.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The work was done using the <strong>Solidity</strong> <strong>programming language</strong>.
