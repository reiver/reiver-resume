			BidClix was the 1st online ad network in existance.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the lead software engineer, I lead a team of software developers which created and maintained BidClix's in-house, proprietary, ad serving technology known as ActiveMarket. I also managed the work of artists and scripters. And was responsible for much of the Research &amp; Development.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I created the <strong>backend</strong>,</li>
			<li>I created the frontend,</li>
			<li>I created the AI â€” a reinforcement learning system with some supervised learning.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I stayed with BidClix through the being acquired by Accipiter, and then aQuantive, and then <strong>Microsoft</strong>.
			The ad technology was later sold to <strong>Facebook</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The work was done using the <strong>PHP</strong> and JavaScript programming languages, the <strong>MySQL</strong>, and the Apache web server.
