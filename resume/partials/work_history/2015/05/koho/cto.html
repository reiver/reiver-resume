			Koho Financial is a FinTech (Financial Technology) company, providing a modern mobile banking experience to Canadians.

		<p>
			I was the <strong>founding <abbr title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO</abbr></strong> at <strong>Koho</strong>.
			After my term as Koho's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), I stayed (as an employee) as an <em>advisor</em>,
			to make sure that the transition (from my term as CTO) to the new term of the replacement CTO went smoothly.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had a key role at Koho.
		</p>
		<p>
			I took the company from nothing, to having a working, functioning, scalable, and secure <strong>banking</strong> software technology system — as well as a fintech banking product on the market with customers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I built out the company's technology, engineering, and product teams.
		</p>
		<p>
			I helped scale the company.
		</p>
		<p>
			A hand-off from something like that takes time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to all this — due to my role being so key — I offered a <em>"6 months notice"</em> period,
			to make sure the transition went smoothly.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the hand-off transition period,
			I made sure the company kept running,
			I transferred knowledge to the replacement,
			I transferred knowledge to the new hires,
			I transitioned control of the technical systems,
			I transitioned the partner relationships.

		<p>

		<p>
			At different times, what it meant to be CTO of Koho changed.
		</p>
		<p>
			But it had always required a mix of skills; which includes:
			having a deep understanding of <em>the technical</em>, of <em>the product</em>, and of <em>people</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I joined Koho a little before we received any funding.
			I was the original technical person,
			and built the initial technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I was the only technical person at Koho, <strong>being CTO meant</strong> that I was a software engineer,
			an architect,
			a data scientist,
			a sysadmin, and
			a product developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Koho got funding, it gave us the ability to recruit and hire our first team.
			This included both software engineers and product developers / managers.
		</p>
		<p>
			When we started hiring our first team, <strong>being CTO meant</strong> I was a recruiter, a networker, and the public "face" of Koho to technical people.
		</p>
		<p>
			This team continued the software and product development, and created the initial versions of Koho.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once this <em>first team</em> was established, <strong>being CTO meant</strong> I was
			a Manager,
			a Lead,
			a mentor,
			a trainer,
			a Technical Director,
			and the Chief Architect.
		</p>
		<p>
			I helped junior and intermediate software engineers turn into senior software engineers.
			And set senior software engineers on the path to becoming leads, managers, and principal software engineers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I provided the technical vision.
		</p>
		<p>
			I provided oversight for everyone's work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, as the company grew and needed to scale, I created a number of new teams, each with their own mandates and responsibilities.
			And each with their own leads or managers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once <em>multiple teams</em> were created, <strong>being CTO meant</strong> I was a Director, I was a Lead of other Leads, and a Manager of other Managers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each time the company went through these qualitative changes, I hired others to do jobs I was previously doing myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			At different times, what it meant to be CTO of Koho changed,
			but it had always required a mix of skills.
			At different times, <strong>being CTO meant</strong>
			being a software manager,
			being a technical director,
			being a software engineer,
			being a software architect,
			being a product manager,
			being a sysadmin (operations / DevOps),
			being a data scientist,
			being a mentor,
			being a recruiter,
			and
			being a lead.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also helped Koho close their $42 million series B investment led by Power Corporation's Portag3 Ventures.
