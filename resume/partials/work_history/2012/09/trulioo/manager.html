			In a start-up environment, it is necessary to wear-many-hats simultaneously â€” Trulioo was no different.
			At Trulioo I worked as the <strong>engineering manager</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Trulioo is a identity company focused on helping credit bureaus as a data provider,
			as well as helping companies comply with KYC, AML, and PEP regulations.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Trulioo I headed the day-to-day activities of the software engineering and data science teams.
			I joined Trulioo while it was at an early phase of the startup lifecycle.
			(The engineering team consisted of just two people, when I joined Trulioo.)
			I hired most of the development team, which included software engineers and data scientists.
		</p>
		<p>
			We built a credit bureau &amp; identity bureau from scratch.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like with most startups, necessity requires you to "wear multiple hats" and do what is necessary to get things done.
			In addition to engineering management, I joined in on the
			software engineering,
			system architecture,
			operations,
			<abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr>,
			<abbr title="database administration">DBA</abbr>,
			and
			data science
			work, when necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			My engineering management activities include
			project planning,
			project management,
			providing technical guidance for system architecture, software engineering &amp; data science efforts,
			creating functional requirements,
			establishing team processes,
			monitoring workflow,
			managing technical aspects of Trulioo's relations with its partners,
			and research and development.
		</p>
		<p>
			My engineering management activities also included
			establishing hiring plans,
			recruiting efforts,
			outreach to the universities,
			outreach via local conferences,
			and networking with local talent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also I managed Trulioo's relationship with the National Research Council Canada for the iRAP program,
			writing <i>academic paper style</i> reports of Trulioo's research and development for the National Research Council Canada,
			and writing grant proposals for the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada's Engage Grant.
		</p>
		<p>
			The work was done using the
			<strong>Go</strong> (i.e., <strong>Golang</strong>),
			the <strong>PHP</strong>,
			and
			the Rust
			<strong>programing languages</strong>, and the
			<strong>MongoDB</strong>
			database server.
