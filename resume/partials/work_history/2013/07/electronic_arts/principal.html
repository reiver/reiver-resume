		<p>
			At Electronic Arts I worked on (and was one of the original founders of) one of the few <em>advanced development teams</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This <em>advanced development team</em> focused on creating
			reusable and often highly scalable technologies
			for web-based applications and in-game content,
			to be used by the various delivery teams.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also created a plan to move Electronic Arts to taking a data-driven and scientific approach
			to marketing, employing machine learning, statistics and data science.
		</p>
		<p>
			More concretely, on a day-to-day basis, my work experience was multifaceted.
			(Which fluctuated to some degree, as accommodations needed to be made when the company went through a number of reorganizations.)
			Overall, those facets of my day-to-day work experience is a follows.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Technical vision</em> was one of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
			I provided the <em>long term vision</em> for (some of the) software systems, technologies and infrastructure.
			Often this amounted to looking at our long term needs and deciding <em>what</em> should be done.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>System architecture</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
			Designing and architecting software systems.
			I am a fan of data-driven architecture; and continued using that technique at Electronic Arts.
			When the problem being solved warranted it,
			<abbr title="proof of concept">POC</abbr>s were created to validate alternate architectures, and choices between <abbr title="proof of concept">POC</abbr> were made based on data from simulations and production data.
			I also had the reified systems instrumented so that we could collect data, and make future architecture decisions based on data.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Software engineering</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
			Which included programming and writing code.
			I am not a fan of (what is sometimes called) "ivory tower architecture" and was adamant about not being one at Electronic Arts.
			I engineered and programmed many of the systems I architected.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Technical oversight</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
			I provided oversight and guidance to other software engineers and system architects,
			both in formal and informal settings.
			Reviewing (some amount of the) major designs and architecture decisions from engineers' &amp; architects' and providing feedback when needed;
			as well as helping to overcome architecture problems that may have been found in the review process.
			Some mentoring was also part of this facet.
			Also, another form of <em>technical oversight</em> was of technical systems and came from a more data-based sources;
			such as time series, tracing and logging data from our production system;
			which indicated architecture problems, and called for action (and sometimes planning) to deal with the discovered problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Hiring</em> was another of the facets of my day-to-day work experience.
			I was involved in (some amount of) the interviewing and screening of potential hires for software engineering and system architecture roles.
		</p>
		<p>
			(This was a 49 Research on-site long term contract, through Ignite Technical.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The work was done using the
			<strong>PHP</strong>,
			Erlang,
			<strong>Go</strong> (i.e., <strong>Golang</strong>),
			JavaScript,
			and
			Scala
			programming languages, the
			MySQL,
			MongoDB,
			<strong>Postgres</strong>,
			database servers, and the
			Nginx
			web server.
