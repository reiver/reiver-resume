		<ul>
			<li>I created a number of custom <strong>WordPress plug-ins</strong> for a number of customers.</li>
		</ul>

			The MakeMake (MakeWordpress.com) story â€”
		</p>
		<p>
			Back when blogging first went mainstream, "everyone" wanted to get into blogging.
			Today blogs and blogging are ubiquitous and banal.
			However, back then blogs were still a new technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time, companies were just starting to get interested blogging
			and feel that it was important to have a coroprate blog.
			And many individuals saw opportunity with blogging.
		</p>
		<p>
			WordPress (a free and open source blogging platform) was in the right place
			at the right time, and became the <em>de facto standard</em> blogging software of the time.
			WordPress was what "everyone" used, when they wanted to set up their own blog.
		</p>
		<p>
			Companies who wanted to use WordPress either wanted to make WordPress look like their
			existing corporate websites or make it look like a PSD file they had an artist create.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, making WordPress look like their website (or the design in a PSD file) was difficult.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's where MakeWordpress.com came in.
			MakeWordpress.com took out the difficulty.
			MakeWordpress.com did all the hard work for the customer.
			MakeWordpress.com made Wordpress look how the customer wanted it to look.
