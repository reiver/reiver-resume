			I worked at Navarik as a <strong>senior software engineer</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Navarik is a software service provider to the petroleum supply and trading industry.
			Its customers include:
			ExxonMobil,
			Chevron,
			Shell,
			P66,
			and others.
		</p>
		<p>
			I joined the Navarik team to fill their need for a <em>very</em> senior level software engineer who could "hit the ground running", so to speak.
			And learn their system at a highly rapid pace, and start making major contributions to the system immediately.
			As a senior software engineer at Navarik, I worked on their flagship product â€” Navarik Inspection.
			Developing the software while working with the team in a Agile environment.
